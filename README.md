## Fnndamentals of AI
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field focused on developing intelligent systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include understanding natural language, recognizing objects, making decisions, solving problems, and learning from experience. AI systems exhibit cognitive abilities like reasoning, perception, and problem-solving across various domains. Some key areas of AI include:
    - Natural Language Processing (NLP): Enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
    - Computer Vision: Allowing computers to "see" and interpret images and videos.
    - Robotics: Developing robots that can perform tasks autonomously or with human guidance.
    - Expert Systems: Creating systems that mimic the decision-making abilities of human experts.

##### Machine Learning (ML)
Is a subfield of AI that focuses on enabling systems to learn from data and improve their performance on specific tasks without explicit programming. ML algorithms use statistical techniques to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies within datasets, allowing the system to make predictions, decisions, or classifications based on new input data.

- ML can be categorized into three main types:
- **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm learns from labeled data, where each data point is associated with a known outcome or label. 
    - Examples  include:
        - Image classification
        - Spam detection
        - Fraud prevention
- **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm learns from unlabeled data without providing an outcome or label. 
    - Examples include:
        - Customer segmentation
        - Anomaly detection
        - Dimensionality reduction
- **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns through trial and error by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback as rewards or penalties. 
    - Examples include:
        - Game playing
        - Robotics
        - Autonomous driving
- For instance, an ML algorithm can be trained on a dataset of images labeled as "cat" or "dog." By analyzing the features and patterns in these images, the algorithm learns to distinguish between cats and dogs. When presented with a new image, it can predict whether it depicts a cat or a dog based on its learned knowledge.

- ML has a wide range of applications across various industries, including:
    - Healthcare: Disease diagnosis, drug discovery, personalized medicine
    - Finance: Fraud detection, risk assessment, algorithmic trading
    - Marketing: Customer segmentation, targeted advertising, recommendation systems
    - Cybersecurity: Threat detection, intrusion prevention, malware analysis
    - Transportation: Traffic prediction, autonomous vehicles, route optimization

- The Relationship Between AI, ML, and DL
    - Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are subfields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enable systems to learn from data and make intelligent decisions. They are crucial enablers of AI, providing the learning and adaptation capabilities that underpin many intelligent systems.
    - ML algorithms, including DL algorithms, allow machines to learn from data, recognize patterns, and make decisions. The various types of ML, such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, each contribute to achieving AI's broader goals. For instance:

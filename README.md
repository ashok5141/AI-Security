## Fnndamentals of AI
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field focused on developing intelligent systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include understanding natural language, recognizing objects, making decisions, solving problems, and learning from experience. AI systems exhibit cognitive abilities like reasoning, perception, and problem-solving across various domains. Some key areas of AI include:
    - Natural Language Processing (NLP): Enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
    - Computer Vision: Allowing computers to "see" and interpret images and videos.
    - Robotics: Developing robots that can perform tasks autonomously or with human guidance.
    - Expert Systems: Creating systems that mimic the decision-making abilities of human experts.
